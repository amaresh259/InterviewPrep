Static:
- The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and
nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

The static can be:
  Variable (also known as a class variable)
  Method (also known as a class method)
  Block
  Nested class

Static Variable:
- The static variable are used to refer to the common property of all objects(Which is unique for each object), for example, the company
name of employees, college name of students etc.
- The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
- It makes your program memory efficient (i.e. It saves memory).
- It stores the last copy. (When any object changes its value it retain its value)
------------------------------------------
Note :
----------------------------------------
- Object reference will store in Stack memory.
- Object(instance details) will store in Heap memory.
- Static details will store in Class Area.
------------------------------------------------

Static Method:
- Static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
- Static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
- Static method can not use non-static data member or call non-static method directly.
- this and super can't be used in static method.

---------------------------------
Note:
---------
Why is the java main method static?
It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, JVM creates object first then call
main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

----------------------------------
Static Block:
- It is used to initialize the static data member.
- It is executed before the main() method at the time of classloading.

-------------------------
Note:
---------
-Can we execute a program without main method?
No, One of the ways was the static block, but it was possible till JDK 1.6. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible to execute a java class
without main method(run time error will occur).
---------------------------
------------------------------------------------
- The instance initializer block is invoked after the parent class constructor is invoked (i.e. after super() constructor call).
- Default Execution flow after class load:
-> Static Block -> main method call
- Default Execution flow after object creation
-> instance block -> Constructor -> Normal Flow
------------------------------------------------
