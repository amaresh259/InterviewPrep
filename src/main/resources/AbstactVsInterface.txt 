1.Difference between Interface vs Abstract class after java 8 ?
I.Constructors:
interfaces can't have constructor
while Abstract classes can contain constructors.

II.Inheritance:
A class can implement multiple interfaces
while it can extend only one abstract class.

III.Access Modifiers:
All methods in an interface are implicitly public
but an abstract class can have methods with any access modifier.

IV.Fields:
Interfaces can only have constant fields (public static final),
whereas an abstract class can have non-final fields.

V.Multiple inheritance:
Interface supports multiple inheritance.
Abstract classes do not support multiple inheritance.

VI.Abstract methods:
In an interface, methods are abstract by default. In an abstract class, you need to use the abstract keyword.

VII.Static and Instance block :
Interface can't contain static and instance block.
but Abstract class can contain.

2.When to go for interface and when to go for abstract class ?
If for most of the implemented class, the implementation is different, then we should go for interface.
If for most of the implemented class, the implementation is the same, then go for Abstract class.

-----------------------
Note
-----------
- We can not achieve multiple inheritance by using interface, if the common method of interfaces has different return type except
covariant type.
