Interface vs Abstract Class after Java 8?
Interface:
1. By default, the member variable is public, static and final.
2. Override the specific default method implementation from required Interface
@override
public void method(){
<Required interface name>.super.<method name>();
}
It will always take precedence while calling method from Required interface which we mentioned in Override method
 in a diamond situation scenario.

Abstract:
1. Variable has no restriction.
